History of java

* In 1990,Sun Micro Systems Inc. was conceived a project to develop software for consumer electronic devices 
  that could be controlled by a remote.This project was called Stealth Project but later its name was changed to Green Project.

* In January 1961, Project Manager James Gosling and his team members Patric Naughton , Mike Sheridan ,Chris Wrath and Ed frank met to discuss about this Project.

* Java is full object oriented language.
* They introduced true arrays and eliminated pointer arithematic.

* They eliminated pointer object arthimetic .

* They eliminated the possibilitiesof confusing an assignment with a test for equality in a conditional statement.
* They eliminated multiple inheritance replacing it with a new notation interface that they derieved from objective C


### "JAVA PROGRAM STRUCTURE" ###


*  Since java is purely an object oriented Programming language , without creating an object to a class it is not possible to access methods and members of a class .
   but main method is also a method inside a class , since program execution starts from main method we ned to call main method without creating an object .

*  Statics methods are the methods , which can be called and executed without creating objects . since we want to call the main method without using an object , We should 
   declare main method as static . JVM calls main method using its Classname.main at the time of running the program.

*  JVM is a program written by java soft people (java development team) and main is the method written by us.
   Since, main method should be available to the JVM ,it should be declared as public . If we don't declare main method as public , then it doesn't make itself available 
   to JVM and JVM executes it.

*  JVM always looks for main method with String type array as parameter otherwise JVM cannot recognize the main method , so we must provide String type array as parameter 
   to main method.

*  A class code starts with a { and ends with a } . A class or an object contains variables and methods (functions). We can create any number of variables and methods
   inside the class.
